# Visualising Flight Data with Tableau


### Summary

Bureau of Transportation Statistics has many datasets. The one used in 
this visualisation has information of over 5 million flights in US 
from 2017.
The Visualisation story follows Average Departure and Arrival delays and
 tries to understand the hidden causes for these delays.

Definitions for common terms:<br>
 **Carrier Delay**: Cause of delay was within airline's control. <br>
 **Late Aircraft Delay**: Cause of delay was a previous delayed flight.
 <br>
 **NAS Delay**: Cause of delay was within's NAtional Airspace System's 
 control.<br>
 **Security Delay**: Cause of delay was a security breach or long lines 
 at screening.<br>
 **Weather delay**: Cause of delay were unfavourable weather conditions.

### Design

The story follows a simple flow. The reader has minimal interaction with
the data itself. I chose the limitation because the data is vast, 
and I did not want any viewers to get lost in the sea of information.

### Feedback
Hi! I really liked your story and the analysis (made me rethink some of 
mine). Looking at the charts - I would suggest to change color of the 
bars on the Delay by Airport. Shouldn't all negative values be green?
